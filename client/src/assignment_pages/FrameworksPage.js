						<h1>Frameworks</h1>
						<p>For our project, two major frameworks were used, namely React and Express, both stemming from the Node.js environment. The following is a brief explanation of both frameworks.</p>
						<h2>React</h2>
						<p>
							React is a flexible and efficient front end javascript library for building UI, and is considered the most in demand in the job markets of 2018.<br />
							It's also considered as one of the most popular javascript frameworks these days.<br />
							Big companies like Twitter, Netflix, Instagram and Airbnb are using React framework.
						</p>
						<h2>Express</h2>
						<p>Express is a javascript framework that is used to make web servers. It allows for the handling of HTTP GET / POST requests as well as serving a variety of dynamic content.</p>

						<h3>Popularity</h3>
						<p>One of the most depended upon NPM packages (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended">https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended</a>), express has been downloaded 26 million times and is very popular among javascript developers. </p>
						<h3>Strengths</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Issues are fixed quickly because express is open source and popular.</li>
							<li>Well-documented.</li>
							<li>Easy to learn.</li>
							<li>Simple if you're making something small.</li>
							<li>Works well with a variety of other node.js packages.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>There is no universal way of doing things.</li>
							<li>Hard to use correctly because of the open endedness</li>
							<li>Can get confusing for large scale projects.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Usage</h3>
						<p>Express is utilized in many major corporations, including but not limited to IBM, Uber, Fox Sports, Mulesoft, etc.</p>
