						<h1>Frameworks</h1>
						<p>For our project, two major frameworks were used, namely React and Express, both stemming from the Node.js environment. The following is a brief explanation of both frameworks.</p>
						<h2>React</h2>
						<p>
							React is a flexible and efficient front end javascript library for building UI, and is considered the most in demand in the job markets of 2018.<br />
							It's also considered as one of the most popular javascript frameworks these days.<br />
							Big companies like Twitter, Netflix, Instagram and Airbnb are using React framework.
						</p>
						<h2>Express</h2>
						<p>
							Express.js is among the top Node.js frameworks.<br />
							Express framework has a minimalist outline that allows the developer to take control of each project and how it will be organized. This provides great flexibility but can be a bit overwhelming to those who are new to Node.js.<br />
							Express is utilized in many major corporations, including but not limited to IBM, Uber, Fox Sports, Mulesoft, etc.
